# Customer Segmentation work using Python

A supermarket, through loyalty cards, has some basic data about its customers, such as age, gender, annual income and spending score. Such a score is something that the supermarket assigns to the customer based on defined parameters, such as customer behavior and purchase data.

The aim of this project is to segment customers based on their purchasing data so that the supermarket can understand customers better and formulate business strategies accordingly.
